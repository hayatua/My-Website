        1.	Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website are you happy with the tools you used?
    </h2>
    <p class="A1">
        To make my website I used the following tools: Visual Studio Code, Trello and GitHub. These three IT tools are effective and allowed me to make a website easily and successfully. Visual Studio Code as an IDE was useful as any mistakes can easily be detected. Furthermore, Trello made project management easier. The tools ability to visualise the project resulted in improved organisation of the whole project. Additionally, GitHub made uploading of the project easier and any changes that were required were easily possible. Therefore, these three IT tools made the project easier and I would not change them.

        2.	Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
    </h3>

    <p class="A2">
        As mentioned in the previous answer, the three IT tools (Visual Studio Code, Trello and GitHub) were appropriate for the project. Speed of the project and productivity was increased due to their use.
    </p>
    <h4 class="Q3">
        3.	Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project
    </h4>
    <p class="A3">
        I believe my website is well designed and the HTML and CSS code used worked well together. Additionally, the website meets the project outcomes therefore making it a success. Despite this however, I believe the website could be improved in terms of visual design.
        </p>

    <h5 class="Q4">
        4.	Describe further improvements you can make to your project
    </h5>
    <p class="A4">
        Expanding on what I just mentioned, the visual design could have been improved. This is the main weakness I believe on my website due to my own lack of creativity as opposed to inability to code. However, I do believe the website gets the job done and a simple website is still appealing to many. Additionally, I have not made any comments within my code. Inclusion of more comments would also improve the project.
    </p>

    <h6 class="Q5">
        5.	Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
    </h6>
    <p class="A5">
        Clear requirements are crucial to a successful project. If requirements are vague, incomplete or inaccurate, a project can be heading towards failure before it even begins. The outcomes of this project line up with the requirements and are therefore fit for purpose.
