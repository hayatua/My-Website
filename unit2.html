    <div class="dropdown">
        <span>1.	Describe the content and layout for each page </span>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>For the about me page I have included an introduction to the website and a few paragraphs about myself and my interests. To make the information stand out I have put them inside boxes with a red border. I have also included images to provide a visual aid. The images can be used to take you to different sites. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Both Unit 1 and Unit 2 pages follow a similar layout. They both begin with a main heading. This is then followed by the outcome question and its answer. When I originally made this page, there was a lot of text. Therefore, to reduce this I included dropdown answers to the questions, so the page does not seem as intimidating and boring.
        <br>
        <br>
        All the pages have a coloured background and a navigation bar at the bottom to aid in navigating the pages.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>This is a form of Intellectual Property. It provides an owner protection against others copying or reproducing their work. This affects websites as it means a website cannot include copyrighted property without permission from the copyright owner.</p>

    <div class="dropdown">
        <span>3.	Describe access issues that need taking into account</span>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>A website needs to be easily reachable and accessible to all audiences. Therefore, considerations must be made to ensure this occurs. For example, it should be possible for website information to be read out loud for a person who may have impaired vision. In addition to this, text could be enlarged, and easily readable fonts should be selected.</p>

      <div class="dropdown">
          <span>4.	Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</span>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p>There are many different filetypes that can be used for websites. The most common file formats include JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF. From these, I have included JPEG on my website.</p>
