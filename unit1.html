        1.	Describing the purpose of IT in modern businesses
    </h2>
    <p class="A1">
        Information Technology (IT) is the study or use of systems for storing, retrieving and sending information and is fundamental to the everyday life in 2020. Although this may not sound like a big deal, it allows you to be able to communicate with anyone in the world via email, video calls and most importantly, instant messaging! In addition to this, IT plays a crucial role in a modern business. This is evident as currently; it is possible to set up a brand-new business from the comfort of your own home. Furthermore, it can be used to grow your business by advertising on social media and other websites where your customers are likely to be.

        2.	Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully
    </h3>

    <p class="A2">
        A key method that aids in completing a digital project successfully is Kanban. Kanban is a lean workflow management system that improves productivity, organisation, efficiency and therefore, to reduce costs. An example of when it has been proven to work is when the Toyota Prius had to be designed and manufactured withing a short timeframe. The four core Kanban principles are: visualise work; limit work in flow progress; focus on flow and continuous improvement. A resource that is useful for completing digital project successfully that compliments Kanban is a Trello board. This is a clutter free, organisation tool that has a “To do”, “Doing” and “Done” section where all work can be managed. Another resource that is important is Visual Studio. It allows you to code whilst easily spotting any errors which makes coding projects easier. Skills required for successful project completion include knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS and an analytical mind.

    <h4 class="Q3">
        3.	Plan and carry out tasks using IT
    </h4>
    <p class="A3">To organise my website creation, I am using a Trello board to plan each section of the website. I am using the checklist feature to ensure all aspects of the project are completed.
    </p>

    <h5 class="Q4">
        4.	Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
    </h5>
    <p class="A4">
        There are several risks that can negatively impact a digital project. A key risk that the project team can easily mitigate is poor organisation and management. This risk can result in the project being delayed, failing to meet deadlines and therefore, increasing the cost of the project. Due to this, the project can fail. External risks that can disrupt a digital project include changes in software and competition. A change in software such as the operating system you are planning on working on being updated can lead to your project no longer being compatible or cause new bugs. Additionally, if a competitor makes a similar product but has a key feature that you do not, it can lead to your work being ignored. Therefore, both these factors can cause a project to fail.
    </p>

    <h6 class="Q5">
        5.	Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
    </h6>
    <p class="A5">
        Selecting the most suited IT systems and software is important as it can make a job much simpler and work in a more robust manner. For example, visual studio would be better suited to a project that required coding compared to the notepad app on your pc. To select the IT systems and software I would make a list of the criteria of the features that I need from the system. Next, I would investigate the systems and software that exist that can carry out either all or most of the criteria. Additionally, if more than one piece of software has all the features required, I would pick the one that is expected to have more long-term support and is user friendly.
    </p>

    <h7 class="Q6">
        6.	Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes
    </h7>

    <p class="A6">
        My chosen technology to help me achieve the projects outcomes were Trello, Visual Studio and GitHub. Trello was crucial to the project management. By clearly setting out tasks that required completion and easily seeing which of these tasks are currently being completed, I could keep track of the whole project. Due to this, I did forget about a task or a project outcome. Visual Studio was also useful as it allowed for the HTML and CSS code to be written with aids for debugging. This helped speed up the project when facing any bugs. GitHub was also important to achieving the project outcomes as it allowed for a space to upload our work. Additionally, when changes were made and reuploaded to Git, it was easy to see the modifications and when they were made therefore, making project management and meeting project outcomes easier.
    </p>

    <h8 class="Q7">
        7.	Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
    </h8>
    <p class="A7">
        Legal guidelines and constraints can impact a digital project. One example of this is by the GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR is European Union law and applies to processing carried out by organisations which includes digital projects. The 7 key principles of the GDPR are as follows:
•	Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
•	Purpose limitation
•	Data minimisation
•	Accuracy
•	Storage limitation
•	Integrity and Confidentiality
•	Accountability
Digital projects are affected by the GDPR as they must adhere to the aforementioned principles.
