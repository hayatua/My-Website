        1.	Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency 
    </h2>
    <p class="A1">
        IT tools such as Trello and Slack improve the productivity and efficiency of a project. Although they require time to use which must be taken from the rest of the project, utilisation of these tools can result in avoiding major errors further down the line. Therefore, overall time can be saved, and productivity of the project increased. To improve efficiency of this project, I could have planned out how my website looks like before beginning actual coding. As I did not do this, I spent a considerable amount of time deleting parts of the website that I realised did not work well with the rest and having to start again.

    <h3 class = "Q2">
        2.	Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    </h3>

    <p class="A2">
        To improve productivity, as mentioned, I could have planned out the website layout prior to creating the website. Additionally, for greater efficiency, I could have coded the CSS of the website in a more concise manner which would have saved time and effort.

    <h4 class="Q3">
        3.	Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
    </h4>
    <p class="A3">
        Next time I complete a digital project, to improve productivity I would do several things differently. A major change I would make is to plan all aspects of the project before jumping right into the work itself. Additionally, I would find resources that may be useful for the project and go through them at the start of the project as opposed to during the project. This would improve my productivity as it means I will have all the knowledge required at the very start therefore, reducing the likelihood of me making any errors at the beginning.
        </p>

    <h5 class="Q4">
        4.	Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h5>
    <p class="A4">
        To test digital solutions to a project, I would make changes one at a time. This would be effective as it allows for any problems to be identified easily and quickly.
